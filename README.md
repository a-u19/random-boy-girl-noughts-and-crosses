# random-boy-girl-noughts-and-crosses

A program that creates a random noughts and crosses board for couples anticipating a newborn and want to gender reveal using noughts and crosses as seen on social media. 

This program:
- reads in the document as an image
- identifies whether the baby is a girl or boy
- creates a random board with the predetermined winner (being specified by the document)
- shows the board cell by cell for different people to put the right colour in the right place

This way no one person will know any of the other colours and the gender reveal can be done as a complete surprise to everybody.
